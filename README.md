# digitaladvertisingpythonhws
Pieces of code I've written in Python for my Digital Advertising Class.
The point of these pieces of code is to use statistical tools to help create advertising insights.

Each python Jupyter Notebook has a dataset that corresponds to it. Each of these datasets are saved to this repository as well, in the CSV file formats.
