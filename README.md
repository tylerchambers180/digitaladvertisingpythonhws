Pieces of code I've written in Python for my Digital Advertising Class.
The point of these pieces of code is to use statistical tools to help create advertising insights.

Each python Jupyter Notebook has a dataset that corresponds to it. Each of these datasets are saved to this repository as well, in the CSV file formats. 

"Formatting text as Dates, Evalutating Correlations and Building a Basic Multiple Linear Regression Model" and "Building a Multiple Linear Regression Model" both use the 'Travel Pony Facebook.csv' dataset.

"Building and Evaluating a Lasso Regression Model" uses the 'finalmaster-ratios.csv' dataset.

"Using Census Data from an API" uses the 'msas.csv' dataset.
